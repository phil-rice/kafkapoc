# A file in which we define the tasks that are needed
# We can have one or many files, but this is meant to be the main one for tasks.
# We just define the interface. Not the implementation (tasks are implemented by services

tasks:

    service: send_notification_default  # This is the default service that we will call to send the notification
    params: # These are the parameters that we pass to the service. Note that these are default values and can be overridden at point of usage, or by geo/product/domain etc
      recipient_email: "{{ recipient_email }}"  # This is the email of the recipient. It is taken from the message or CEP state
